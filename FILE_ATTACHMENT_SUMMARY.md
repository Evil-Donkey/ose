**Purpose:** This document - overview of the entire solution

## What You Need to Do

### In WordPress (Required)

1. **Upload the plugin:**
   - Upload `wordpress-cf7-file-url-in-email.php` to `/wp-content/plugins/`
   - Go to Plugins and activate "CF7 File Attachment Handler"

2. **Configure Contact Form 7:**
   - Go to Contact → Contact Forms → Edit Form (ID: 1568)
   - Click the "Mail" tab
   - In the "File Attachments" field, add: `[file]`
   - Save the form

3. **Test it:**
   - Submit a test form with a file
   - Check if the email arrives with the attachment

### Optional but Recommended

1. **Install an SMTP plugin** (WP Mail SMTP or Easy WP SMTP)
   - This significantly improves email delivery reliability
   - Especially important for attachments

2. **Enable WordPress debug logging** (for troubleshooting)
   - Edit `wp-config.php`
   - Add debug configuration (see checklist)

## How to Test

1. Go to your form: https://yoursite.com/form
2. Fill out all fields
3. Upload a test file (try a small PDF first)
4. Submit the form
5. Check the email - the file should be attached

## Expected Behavior

### Before the Fix
- ❌ Files upload successfully to WordPress
- ❌ Form submission succeeds
- ❌ Email is sent
- ❌ **BUT:** No file attachment in the email

### After the Fix
- ✅ Files upload successfully to WordPress
- ✅ Form submission succeeds
- ✅ Email is sent
- ✅ **AND:** File is attached to the email!

## Debug Logging

After activation, check `/wp-content/debug.log` for messages like:

```
Contact Form 7 - Files uploaded and will be attached:
  - Field: file, File: Rateyourcyber_accelerate.pdf (2.5 MB)
```

This confirms files are being processed correctly.

## Potential Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Files still not attaching
**Possible causes:**
1. "File Attachments" field not configured in CF7
2. Email server blocking attachments
3. File size too large for email provider
4. SMTP not configured properly

**Solutions:**
1. Double-check CF7 mail configuration
2. Install SMTP plugin
3. Test with smaller files first
4. Check WordPress debug logs

### Issue: Emails going to spam
**Solution:** 
- Install and configure an SMTP plugin
- Emails with attachments trigger spam filters more often
- SMTP plugins provide proper authentication

### Issue: File size limit errors
**Solutions:**
1. Reduce the file size limit in the form (currently 3MB)
2. Increase server limits (see configuration guide)
3. Ask users to compress files before uploading

## File Size Considerations

Current form limit: **3MB** (good for most documents)

Email provider limits:
- Gmail: 25MB
- Outlook: 20MB
- Most hosting: 10-25MB

**Recommendation:** Keep the 3MB limit to ensure reliability.

## Alternative Approach

If attachments continue to fail (due to server restrictions or email provider limitations), you can switch to a **URL-based approach** where the email includes download links instead of attachments.

To do this:
1. Check the git history for the URL-based version
2. Or contact support for the alternative implementation

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Upload `wordpress-cf7-file-url-in-email.php` to WordPress
2. ✅ Activate the plugin
3. ✅ Add `[file]` to File Attachments in CF7 Mail settings
4. ✅ Test with a form submission
5. ✅ (Optional) Install WP Mail SMTP for better reliability
6. ✅ Monitor debug logs for any issues

## Support

For issues:
1. Review `CF7_CONFIGURATION_CHECKLIST.md`
2. Check `CF7_FILE_URL_SETUP.md` troubleshooting section
3. Review WordPress debug logs
4. Test with different file sizes and types
